# Need of Numpy 
'''
1. Creation of Array/Matrices
2. Perform several operations on arrays/matrices
3. Perform integral calculus operations
4. Solving Differential equations
5. Statistics related operations etc. 

Too perform these comlex mathematical operatons, python does not contain any inbuilt library. 

To perform these complex operations we require a library which is nothing but numpy.
