# 1. Need or Purpose of Numpy 
'''
1. Creation of Array/Matrices
2. Perform several operations on arrays/matrices
3. Perform integral calculus operations
4. Solving Differential equations
5. Statistics related operations etc. 

Too perform these comlex mathematical operatons, python does not contain any inbuilt library. 

To perform these complex operations we require a library which is nothing but numpy.
Because of these extra libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib , sklearn etc. 

Python is recommonded language for Data Science, Machine learning, Deep learning etc. 

'''

# 2. History of Numpy and What is Numpy 

'''
- Numpy Stands for Numerical Python Library. 
- It is the fundamental Python library to perform complex mathematical operations. 
- NumPy is developed on top of Numeric Library. 
- Numeric Library developed by Jim Hugunin. 
- Numpy is developed by Travis Oliphant and multiple contributors. 
- Numpy is freeware and open source library.
'''
# 3. In which language Numpy was written?

'''
Numpy was written in Python and C languages. 
As most of numpy written in C, performance wise Numpy is good(speed is more). 

Because of high speed numpy is best choice for ML Algorithms than traditional python's inbuild data structures like : List.

'''

#4. Various features of Numpy 

'''
1. Numpy is superfast because it is written in C language. 
2. Numpy acts as backbone for Data Science Libraries like pandas, scikit-learn et. 
    pandas and skitic-learn used 'na- array' to store data, which is numpy data structure.
    
3. Numpy has vectorization feature which which improves performance while iterating elements.
'''

# 5. Advantage of numpy array over Python's in built List?
'''
Performance is very high. 
'''

# 6. Application Areas of Numpy? 
'''
1. To perform linear Algebra functions
2. To perform linear regression
3. To perform logistic regression
4. Deep Neural Networks
5. K-means clustering
6. Operational Research
7. Control System
 
Numpy is the fundamental and copulsory required library for Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning etc.
